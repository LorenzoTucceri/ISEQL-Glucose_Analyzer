# ISEQL-Glucose Analyzer

Managing diabetes requires continuous monitoring of blood glucose levels to prevent complications. This project focuses on analyzing time-series glucose data to model different glycemic conditions: normal, extremely high, high, low, and extremely low. Using Python tools like Pandas and NumPy, we perform data cleaning, segmentation into intervals, and employ ISEQL for complex event detection. Our proposed architecture includes a data crawler for raw data extraction, an interval action detector for event annotation, and a high-level event detector for complex event identification. Results highlight effective glucose level analysis for diabetes management, emphasizing pattern recognition and anomaly detection across various time intervals. This approach enhances understanding of glucose behaviors critical for personalized treatment strategies.
